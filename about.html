        Hello! My name is Danielle and I am a senior at Michigan State University.
        I am majoring in computer science with a cognate in media and information,
        and minoring in graphic design.
    </p>

    <p>
        Web design has been a big interest of mine, and I could really see myself pursuing it,
         or something similar to it, in my future. I currently work as a graphic designer for 
         the College of Engineering K-12 Outreach Office at MSU, and took an internship as a Product 
         Designer at Ford for this summer. Both of these experiences are really helping me to find my 
         passion and realize how much the design industry interests me.
