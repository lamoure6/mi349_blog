<h2>The Importance of Staying Active</h2>

<p>
    One thing I found that is so easy to forget to incorporate into our daily routines is some form 
    of exercise. At the beginning of last year (at the start of covid), I found it difficult to find
    motivation to fit in a workout, especially with most gyms closed at the time. I got in the habit
    of not adding any workout to my daily routine. Eventually, I found that this began affecting my
    overall productivity and energy as well. That's when I realized how important it was to find
    some way to stay active, even when you don't feel like doing it.
</p>
<p>
    There are so many ways you can stay active and get in some exercise; it doesn't have to mean 
    getting a gym membership or doing intense daily workouts. Staying active can be as simple as 
    dedicating some time each day for a walk or run to just get some fresh air, or following along 
    with an at-home workout at your own pace. Eventually, after doing small amounts of exercise each
    day, it will start to become a habit. Making more healthy habits can start to improve your 
    overall motivation to workout more or, at the very least, make you feel healthier and happier!

<h2>Tips To Stay Organized</h2>
<p><img src="planner.jpg" alt="Photo of a weekly planner" width="560" height="373"></p>
<p>
    Staying organized can be a difficult skill to maintain, especially if you have a busy schedule. 
    Having a good organizational method can improve overall productivity and performance, which is 
    why it’s important to find what works best for you.  
</p>
<p>
    With having all of my classes online this year, I needed to find a good method of organization 
    that worked for me and allowed me to stay on top of all my class assignments and work deadlines. 
    These tips to stay organized differ from person to person, however these are just some of the 
    main ones that worked for me…
</p>

<h3>Keep a weekly schedule.</h3>
<p>
    I found that keeping a digital weekly schedule is helpful for me because it allows me to 
    visualize my entire week’s workload and break up my assignments and deadlines rather than 
    stress on bigger things all at once. When I saw my bigger assignment broken up throughout the 
    week, I found I was less overwhelmed, and I was able to stay on track with where I needed to be. 
</p>

<h3>Make sure your work space is clean.</h3>
<p>
    This is one of the most important tips that work for me because whenever I have a messy and 
    cluttered work space, I feel that it’s harder to concentrate solely on the work I’m trying to 
    get done. Simply clearing your desk or the room you're working in can make a big difference in 
    your mindset and clear your head before accomplishing any of your tasks.  
</p>

<h3>Take timed breaks.</h3>
<p>
    When working for long periods of time, it’s important to find time to relax your mind for a few 
    minutes and take a break. However, breaks can turn into hours which could negatively affect your 
    productive mindset.  A solution I found to this is to set timer intervals of working then 
    break times. If I had a bigger assignment to get done, I found that working for 1 hour, followed 
    by a 10-15 minute break in between each hour of working helped me stay focused while also 
    allowing my mind to rest and not be overwhelmed.
